1.	What color choices did you make and why?

The colors that I chose are: Black for the text, White as the background, and blue as a color of the icons; I also choose the blue as a urgent notice for the users to see it easily.

2. How did you apply accessibility fixes?

I made sure the text had enough contrast against the background, used readable fonts, and added clear labels and icons so users can easily navigate the site.

3. What challenges did you face?

I find it hard to understand how to use Wordpress to customize my website theme because I frequently edit a templates through Canva. However, I manage to find a way to fix it by searching on Youtube for tutorials and exploring different types of feature on Wordpress.
